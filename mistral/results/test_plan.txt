A test plan for the login screen would typically include the following:

1. Test Objective:
The main objective of testing the login screen is to ensure that it functions correctly and securely, allowing authorized users to access the application while preventing unauthorized access.
2. Test Scope:
The scope of testing the login screen includes testing all possible user inputs, validation checks, error messages, password reset functionality, and security features.
3. Test Inputs:
The test inputs for the login screen testing include valid and invalid username and password combinations, empty fields, special characters, and different keyboard layouts.
4. Test Cases:
The test cases for the login screen testing can be divided into functional and non-functional tests. Functional tests include testing the login functionality with valid and invalid credentials, password visibility toggle, remember me option, and forgotten password link. Non-functional tests include testing the performance of the login screen under different network conditions, testing the responsiveness of the login screen on different devices, and testing the security of the login screen by attempting to bypass authentication.
5. Test Environment:
The test environment should replicate the production environment as closely as possible. This includes using the same hardware, software, network configurations, and security policies.
6. Test Schedule:
The test schedule should be planned in advance to ensure that testing is completed before the release date. The schedule should include time for planning, test case development, test execution, defect tracking, and regression testing.
7. Test Tools:
Test tools that can be used for login screen testing include automated testing tools such as Selenium, manual testing tools such as pen and paper, and security testing tools such as Burp Suite.
8. Test Deliverables:
The test deliverables for login screen testing include test cases, test scripts, test data, test results, and defect reports. These deliverables should be reviewed and approved by the stakeholders before the release of the application.
9. Test Risks:
The test risks associated with login screen testing include incomplete or incorrect test cases, insufficient testing time, and lack of skilled resources.
10. Test Mitigation:
To mitigate the risks associated with login screen testing, it is important to have a clear and detailed test plan, allocate sufficient time for testing, and have skilled resources available to perform testing. Additionally, regular communication with stakeholders can help identify and address any issues that arise during testing.

Overall, a comprehensive test plan for the login screen will help ensure that the login functionality is reliable, secure, and user-friendly, providing a positive user experience and protecting the application from unauthorized access.
