Here are 20 essential test cases for testing a login screen with the given UI elements, links, and forms:

1. Verify that the login screen is displayed with all the required fields (Email, Password) and links (Forgot your password?, Create account).

2. Test a successful login with valid email and password credentials.

3. Test a failed login with an invalid email format.

4. Test a failed login with an incorrect password.

5. Verify that the password field masks the entered characters.

6. Test the login with an email address that doesn't exist in the system.

7. Attempt to log in with an empty email field and verify the error message.

8. Attempt to log in with an empty password field and verify the error message.

9. Test the login with both email and password fields left empty and verify the error message.

10. Verify that the "Sign in" button is enabled only when both email and password fields are filled.

11. Test the login with a valid email but an incorrect case (uppercase/lowercase) and ensure it is not case-sensitive.

12. Verify that the user is redirected to the appropriate page upon successful login.

13. Test the "Forgot your password?" link and ensure it redirects to the password recovery page.

14. Verify that the password recovery page asks for the registered email address.

15. Test the password recovery functionality with a valid email address and ensure a recovery email is sent.

16. Test the password recovery functionality with an unregistered email address and verify the error message.

17. Verify that the "Create account" link redirects to the user registration page.

18. Test the login with a password that exceeds the maximum character limit and verify the error message.

19. Verify that the user session is securely managed (e.g., session ID is not exposed in the URL, session timeout after inactivity).

20. Test the login screen on different browsers and devices to ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.

These test cases cover the essential functionalities and validations of a login screen. However, depending on the specific requirements and security considerations of your application, you may need to include additional test cases to ensure a comprehensive testing coverage.
